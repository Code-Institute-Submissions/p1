### How does it work
 
This website uses:
  • HTML - This allowed me to create the code for the site and all of the components of the site.
  • CSS - This allowed to style the CSS code to make the website more responsive and appealing to the user.
  • Javascript - I used the Javascript to make the registration form more responsive and reactive to the user by making a drop down box appear when the user had completed the form. This was done in a seperate Js file.
